# Process

Domain: `process`

Process, module, memory diagnostics, and controlled injection domain for host-level inspection, troubleshooting, and Windows process experimentation workflows.

## Profiles

- full

## Typical scenarios

- Enumerate processes and inspect modules
- Diagnose memory failures and export audit trails
- Perform controlled DLL/shellcode injection in opt-in environments

## Common combinations

- process + debugger
- process + platform

## Representative tools

- `electron_attach` — Attach to an Electron CDP port and optionally evaluate in a matching page.
- `process_windows` — Get all window handles for a process.
- `process_check_debug_port` — Check if a process has a debug port enabled for CDP attachment.
- `process_launch_debug` — Launch an executable with remote debugging port enabled.
- `memory_read` — Read memory from a process at a specific address. Requires elevated privileges.
- `memory_write` — Write data to process memory at a specific address. Requires elevated privileges.
- `memory_scan` — Scan process memory for a pattern or value. Requires elevated privileges.
- `memory_check_protection` — Check memory protection flags at a specific address.
- `memory_scan_filtered` — Scan memory within a filtered set of addresses (secondary scan).
- `memory_batch_write` — Write multiple memory patches at once.
