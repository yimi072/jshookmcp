# Debugger

Domain: `debugger`

CDP-based debugging domain covering breakpoints, stepping, call stacks, watches, and debugger sessions.

## Profiles

- workflow
- full

## Typical scenarios

- Set and hit breakpoints
- Evaluate expressions in frames
- Save and restore debugger sessions

## Common combinations

- debugger + hooks
- debugger + antidebug

## Representative tools

- `debugger_lifecycle` — Manage the debugger lifecycle (enable or disable)
- `debugger_pause` — Pause execution at the next statement
- `debugger_resume` — Resume execution (continue)
- `debugger_step` — Step execution: into (enter next call), over (skip next call), out (exit current function).
- `breakpoint` — Manage breakpoints: code (line/script), XHR (URL pattern), event listener, event category, and exception breakpoints.
- `get_call_stack` — Get the current call stack (only available when paused at a breakpoint)
- `debugger_evaluate` — Evaluate a JavaScript expression. context="frame" evaluates in the current call frame (requires paused state); context="global" evaluates in the global context (no pause required).
- `debugger_wait_for_paused` — Wait for the debugger to pause (useful after setting breakpoints and triggering code)
- `debugger_get_paused_state` — Get the current paused state (check if debugger is paused and why)
- `get_object_properties` — Get all properties of an object (when paused, use objectId from variables)
