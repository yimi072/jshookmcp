# Encoding

Domain: `encoding`

Binary format detection, encoding conversion, entropy analysis, and raw protobuf decoding.

## Profiles

- workflow
- full

## Typical scenarios

- Identify unknown payload formats
- Convert between encodings
- Decode schema-less protobuf payloads

## Common combinations

- network + encoding

## Representative tools

- `binary_detect_format` — Detect binary payload format and encoding signals.
- `binary_decode` — Decode binary payloads into hex, utf8, or json output
- `binary_encode` — Encode utf8/hex/json input into base64/hex/url output
- `binary_entropy_analysis` — Compute entropy and byte frequency for a payload.
- `protobuf_decode_raw` — Decode base64 protobuf bytes without schema using wire-type aware recursive parser
