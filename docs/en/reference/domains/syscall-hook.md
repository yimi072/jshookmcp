# Syscall Hook

Domain: `syscall-hook`

System call hooking domain providing system call monitoring and mapping capabilities.

## Profiles

- full

## Typical scenarios

- System call monitoring
- API hooking
- Behavioral analysis

## Common combinations

- syscall-hook + process
- syscall-hook + hooks

## Representative tools

- `syscall_start_monitor` — Start syscall monitoring using ETW, strace, or dtrace.
- `syscall_stop_monitor` — Stop syscall monitoring.
- `syscall_capture_events` — Capture syscall events from the active or last monitoring session.
- `syscall_correlate_js` — Correlate captured syscalls with likely JavaScript functions.
- `syscall_filter` — Filter captured syscall events by syscall name.
- `syscall_get_stats` — Get syscall monitoring statistics.
- `syscall_ebpf_trace` — Trace syscalls via Linux eBPF/bpftrace. Requires root or CAP_BPF.
