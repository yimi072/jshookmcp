# Protocol Analysis

Domain: `protocol-analysis`

Custom protocol analysis domain supporting protocol pattern definition, automatic field detection from hex payloads, state machine inference from captured messages, and Mermaid diagram visualization.

## Profiles

- full

## Typical scenarios

- Custom protocol pattern definition
- Automatic field boundary detection from hex payloads
- State machine inference from captured message sequences
- Mermaid state diagram generation

## Common combinations

- network + protocol-analysis
- encoding + protocol-analysis

## Representative tools

- `proto_define_pattern` — Define a protocol pattern with delimiter, byte order, and field layout
- `proto_auto_detect` — Auto-detect a protocol pattern from one or more hex payload samples
- `proto_infer_fields` — Infer likely protocol fields from repeated hex payload samples
- `proto_infer_state_machine` — Infer a protocol state machine from captured message sequences
- `proto_export_schema` — Export a protocol pattern to a .proto-like schema definition
- `proto_visualize_state` — Generate a Mermaid state diagram from a protocol state machine definition
- `payload_template_build` — Build a deterministic payload from field definitions.
- `payload_mutate` — Apply deterministic byte-level mutations to a hex payload.
- `ethernet_frame_build` — Build a deterministic Ethernet II frame from source/destination MAC addresses, EtherType, and payload bytes.
- `arp_build` — Build a deterministic ARP payload for Ethernet/IPv4 style address resolution packets.
